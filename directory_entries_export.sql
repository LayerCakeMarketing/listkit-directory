We pioneer, curious and unfaltering, determined not to stop until we achieve mouth-watering perfection, often at the expense of reasonable bedtimes and our social lives.

The EATery is located in the tasting room, supplying amazing beer-centric food by chef Brandon Brocia. Check out The EATery menu here. Savor a pint and a bite to eat, sample a tasting flight, pick up a 6-pack, fill your growler, and enjoy the mountain views and friendly atmosphere.</p><p>Your well-behaved, leashed pupper is welcome in our outdoor beer garden. No barking, biting, or begging, and don't leave your trail buddy unattended.</p><p>Fun events include live music and Trivia Night, and we also host private events.
