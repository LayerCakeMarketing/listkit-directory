# Tasks Completed - July 20, 2025

## Place Creation and Review Workflow

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Admin Navigation**
   - Added "Pending Approval" submenu under Places in admin sidebar
   - Fixed navigation visibility in correct layout file (`/frontend/src/layouts/AdminLayout.vue`)

2. **Implemented Place Draft Workflow**
   - All new places now start as 'draft' status regardless of user type
   - Places can be edited multiple times while in draft status
   - Added "Submit for Review" button for draft/rejected places
   - Locked editing for regular users when status is 'pending_review'
   - Admin/managers can still edit pending places

3. **Created Place Preview Component**
   - Built `PlacePreview.vue` component for simulated preview
   - Shows place details without navigation or active links
   - Real-time updates as user edits the form
   - Replaced iframe "Live View" with non-navigable "Preview"

4. **Updated Edit Page Layout**
   - Split view: edit form on left (5/12), preview on right (7/12)
   - Fixed positioning for breadcrumbs and header
   - Adjusted padding to 5.3rem for proper spacing
   - Added toggle button to show/hide edit panel

5. **Fixed MyPlaces Page**
   - Hide "View" button for draft and pending_review places
   - Show appropriate status badges
   - Center buttons when only Edit button is visible

6. **Fixed Place Approval Process**
   - Temporarily disabled email notifications due to table structure mismatch
   - Fixed namespace imports for notification classes
   - Added error logging for debugging
   - Made notification table columns nullable to prevent SQL errors

### üîß Technical Changes

- Modified `Place.php` model to prevent editing when status is 'pending_review' (except for admin/manager)
- Updated `PlaceController.php` to always create places with 'draft' status
- Added `PlaceApprovedNotification.php` and `PlaceRejectedNotification.php` (currently disabled)
- Created migrations to fix notification table structure
- Fixed breadcrumb and header positioning classes in Edit.vue

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- Notifications are temporarily disabled due to custom notifications table structure not matching Laravel's expected schema
- Need to refactor notification system to either:
  - Use Laravel's standard notifications table structure
  - Create custom notification handling that works with existing table

### üìù Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No data loss or breaking changes
- Git commit created for backup: "Fix place workflow: draft status, preview component, and approval process"
